Definition,,,,,
"Sufficient physical activity in this indicator is defined as undertaking moderate intensity physical activity for a total of at least 150 minutes per week over five separate occasions.However, the national guidelines apply different criteria for different age groups. The 2014 guideline for adults aged 18 to 64 years recommends a combination of moderate and vigorous activities on most or all days of the week, as well as strength training on at least 2 days and minimising sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting. For older Australians aged 65 years and over, the 2014 guideline recommend 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most, or preferably all days.",,,,,
Inclusions & Exclusions,,,,,
"In 2023, there were 10,472 respondents to this question.",,,,,
Adults are defined as persons aged 16 years and over in the NSW Population Health Survey.,,,,,
Details of respondents over time for this indicator are available here.,,,,,
Statistical Methods,,,,,
"The indicator shows self-reported data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). In order to address diminishing coverage of the population by landline telephone numbers (<85% since 2010), a mobile phone number sampling frame was introduced into the 2012 survey. Between 2012 and 2019, the mobile phone number sampling frame made up approximately 30% of the sampling frame. From 2021, the survey is solely using a mobile phone number based sampling frame.",,,,,
"The inclusion of mobile phone numbers has substantially increased the Aboriginal sample and this change in design means that the 2012 NSW Population Health Survey estimates reflect both changes that have occurred in the population over time and changes due to the improved design of the survey. With the change of the sampling frame in 2021 to being completely mobile phone based, there has been a further increase in the Aboriginal sample. Consequently, estimates for 2021 will reflect changes in both the population in this time and changes due to the further improved design of the survey.",,,,,
Estimates were weighted to adjust for differences in the probability of selection among respondents and were benchmarked to the estimated residential population using the latest available Australian Bureau of Statistics mid-year population estimates.,,,,,
"This indicator applies the same questions and calculation method to all those aged 16 years and over, despite some differences in the guidelines for different adult age groups.",,,,,
The guidelines relating to physical activity and sedentary behaviour were updated in 2014 and that definition has been applied to the entire time series shown.,,,,,
,,,,,
Dimensions/Variables,,,,,
"English speaking countries include: Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States.",,,,,
Local Health Districts (LHDs) are health administrative areas constituted under Section 17 of the NSW Health Services Act 1997 which became effective from January 2011 and were initially called Local Health Networks.,,,,,
"All LHDs includes LHDs where numbers are too low to be individually included, and records where the LHD was missing or not stated.",,,,,
Albury Local Government Area (LGA) is included in All LHDs.,,,,,
Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are health administrative areas which represent primary health care organisations in Australia from July 2014.,,,,,
All PHNs include records where the Primary Health Network is missing or not stated as well as records assigned to the NSW portion of the Murray PHN.,,,,,
Postal Areas (POAs) were grouped according to the Australian Statistical Geographical Standard (ASGS) remoteness categories on the basis of Accessibility/Remoteness Index for Australia (ARIA version) score. Data prior to 2016 are based on the 2011 ARIA version and data for 2016 and onwards are based on the 2016 ARIA version.,,,,,
Quintiles of socioeconomic status (Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage) based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas were allocated based on Postal Area of residence.,,,,,
Regional health district in NSW is defined on the basis of Local Health District (LHD) geographic areas. Details of classification are available here.,,,,,
