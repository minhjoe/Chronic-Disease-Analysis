# Analysis of Chronic Diseases in NSW

Welcome to the repository for my "Analysis of Chronic Diseases in NSW" project, prepared as part of the BUSA8031 – Business Analytics Project. This work represents an in-depth exploration of preventable chronic diseases across New South Wales (NSW), focusing on their causes, trends, and regional disparities, with actionable recommendations for improving public health outcomes.

## Project Overview

### Client
NSW Health (Agency for Clinical Innovation)

### Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze chronic disease trends, understand contributing factors such as lifestyle and socioeconomic disparities, and propose evidence-based strategies to address these health challenges in NSW.

### Key Focus Areas

#### Primary Risk Factors
- Obesity  
- Smoking and Vaping  
- Poor Diet  
- Insufficient Physical Activity  
- Alcohol Consumption  

#### Demographic and Regional Disparities
- Gender and Age Differences  
- Socioeconomic and Geographic Variability  

#### Healthcare System Insights
- Utilization of Primary Care Services  
- Regional Disparities in Access  
- Government Interventions and Their Impact

## Methodology

### Data Sources
I collected data from:
- Australian Health Performance Framework (AHPF)  
- HealthStats NSW  
- Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)  

### Tools and Techniques
- Data Processing: Python, RStudio for statistical analysis and data cleaning.  
- Visualization: Tableau to create interactive dashboards.  
- Documentation: Confluence for project management and collaboration.  

### Analytical Approach
- Segmenting data by demographics (age, gender) and geography to uncover disparities.  
- Leveraging dashboards for a clear visual representation of chronic disease patterns.  
- Answering non-trivial questions about preventable diseases, including their causes and socioeconomic impacts.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

### Findings
- Disparities in Chronic Diseases: Regional and socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes are significant, with rural and low-SES areas most affected.  
- Lifestyle Factors: Rising trends in vaping and alcohol consumption counteract progress in reducing smoking-related health risks.  
- At-Risk Demographics: Men aged 65–74 show disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease.  

### Recommendations
- Healthcare Access: Expand telehealth and mobile clinic services to underserved regions.  
- Public Health Campaigns: Promote healthy eating, physical activity, and responsible alcohol use through targeted awareness efforts.  
- Policy Interventions: Address vaping trends and strengthen support for preventive care initiatives.
